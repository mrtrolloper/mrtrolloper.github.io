												<h3>Flykten Från Gävle</h3>
												<p>Ädelfors Folkhögskola / 2021 - 2021<br><br>
													I worked as a UI and menu designer and programmer. The project was two days long.<br><br>
													In this 2D platformer game, you play as the famous Gävle Goat and the objective is to run away from a
													devastating fire. <br /> <br />
													I built the main menu from scratch, using pre-made images and my programming skills to give the buttons a function. On top of that, I added a particle effect system to the menu
													and placed it right above the panels. I also built the health bar which is located top left in the game.

												<h3>Happy Pizza Friends</h3>
												<p>Ädelfors Folkhögskola / 2021 - 2021 <br /> <br />
													I worked as a programmer and designer. The project was three days long.<br><br>
													The protagonist, a cute scooter bear, is stuck inside a pizza world.
													The player's objective is to catch the falling pizza slices to keep the bear alive. <br /> <br />
													In this small game I worked on pretty much everything. I created a pizza slice spawner that has an object pool spawner and randomised falling speed,
													and placed it right above the viewport. I also made it possible for the bear to grow and shrink, based on the amount of pizzas the bear has.
													The pizzas at the bottom are simply 2D sprites which changes with an int value that stores the amount of collected pizzas. <br /> <br />
													And last but not least, I also animated those funny organs that fly out when the bear explodes. The image popping up at the bottom right and the credits screen are also my work.

												<h3>Labyrinth Of Lost Souls</h3>
												<p>Ädelfors Folkhögskola / 2021 - 2021<br><br>
													I worked as a game programmer and designer. The project was five weeks long.<br><br>
													In this first-person fighting game the player has to walk through mazes, avoid traps, kill enemies and go through portals. <br /> <br />
													My task was to make the player jump from tile to tile, depending on which one the player clicks on. The tiles themselves are spawned by a single object
													which instantiates a certain amount of cubes. The game is also turn based, so there's a that checks for whose turn it is and prevents the player from moving constantly.
													There's also an AI that follows a simple path, which in this case are some invisible blue spheres.

												<h3>Shader Showcase</h3>
												<p>Ädelfors Folkhögskola / 2021 - 2021<br><br>
													I worked as a game programmer and designer. The project was three weeks long.<br><br>
													One part of the programming course moment was to learn how to create shaders.
													We used Unity's tool "shader graph" for this moment to create various kinds of effects,
													such as waves in water and wind effects on trees. This is a video of everything I made during the course moment.

												<h3>Cyber Claus</h3>
												<p>Ädelfors Folkhögskola / 2020 - 2020<br><br>
													I worked as a game programmer and UI designer. The project was five days long.<br><br>
													In this 2D platformer game the player has to avoid traps and viruses in a cyber looking environment,
													and reach the goal that's at the end of the map. <br /> <br />
													For this game I worked with the controls and shooting mechanic for the character. The shooting mechanic is a simple object pool which sets a force and an amount
													for the snowballs. The gift bombs are also pretty simple, activates on key press and has a timer which counts down before the bomb explodes and kill nearby enemies.
													I used rigidbody to create the movement for the character and made it rotate when the player presses on the a and d keys. The arm also rotates to where the player is aiming.
													I also made the gingerbread hearts (the player's life) at the top right, by checking a value and increasing/decreasing the life accordingly.

												<h3>Noble's Forest Dump</h3>
												<p>Ädelfors Folkhögskola / 2020 - 2020 <br><br>
													I worked as a game programmer and designer. The project was five weeks long.<br><br>
													In this 2D game you play as a cute squirrel and have to complete mini-games and save the world from brutal climate changes. <br /> <br />
													This was my second big game project, and my task was to create the trash bin mini-game. The mini-game itself is almost identical to Tetris,
													so all I had to do was to replicate the controls from the classic game. The player can choose where to drop the trash and they will fall step by step with an Y value
													inside a grid, just like Tetris. The items will collide with each other and once the trash has reached the top, it's game over. <br /> <br />
													I also worked with the score system on top of the screen, and the acorns that appears after each game over. The sprite's fill amount increases with the score for that round.
													This was also the first time I worked with data storing and I wrote a function which saves the high score to a local file.

												<h3>Unity Development</h3>
												<p>
													Mindflower AB / 2023 - 2023 <br><br>
													During my employment, I obtained the opportunity to work in a small team to produce mobile applications for many different companies.
													Our main goal was to help customers visualise data with the use of the game engine Unity.
													As a Unity developer, I was directed to implement new designs, which could vary between anything from UI/UX to solve complex bugs.
													We were using fast prototypes and extreme programming during two weeks short sprint schedules, with a demo of the result. <br /> <br />

													In summary, my tasks were to: <br />
													* implement made designs to the projects <br />
													* use Scrum to estimate and structure my tasks during sprints <br />
													* use Unity as the main tool to develop, alongside with Visual Studio <br />
													* quickly build a prototype with extreme programming <br />
													* program and gather data using websockets
